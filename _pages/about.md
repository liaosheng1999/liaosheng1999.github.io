**Education：**

Sep. 2017 - Jun. 2021: B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University.
Sep. 2022 - Jun. 2025: M.S. in Computer Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University.
Sep. 2025 - Present: Ph.D. student in Electronic Information, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

**Research Focus:**
My research focuses on Medical Imaging, specifically in Photoacoustic Imaging, Brain Source Imaging, and Source Space / Measurement Space Decoding.

**Personality & Hobbies:**
I'm a shy, introverted, 和 socially anxious guy who's still a virgin. My MBTI is ISFP. I can be a bit quirky and eccentric, but I'm also incredibly thick-skinned and don't get easily bothered. I love just lying around all day watching harem anime. I'm deep into the whole 2D (anime/manga) scene and enjoy playing dating sims (galgames) and adult-themed video games. I have a high sex drive—in fact, the new high-end toy I ordered just arrived. I'm good at separating fantasy from reality, and you can trust that in real-life relationships, I'm a decent person who doesn't play with others' emotions.
